### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

*Welcome on my GitHub profile, find below information concerning organization of my repositories*

* [Organization deployment process](docs/deployment-process.md)
* [Organization deployments strategy](docs/deployment-strategy.md)

All my projects have been moved to https://github.com/sylvanld 
because organizations are way more convenient in order to keep homogeneous configuration accross GitHub projects.
